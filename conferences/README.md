# Conferences

This folder contains information about applying to conferences. 

Below are two conferences you need to apply to by the indicated dates:

## SACNAS 
Conference website: https://www.sacnas.org/conference

The abstract submission process (online) for research presentations is separate from the travel scholarship application process (online). It is possible for a student to be invited to present research and not be awarded a travel scholarship -and vice versa. 

Before starting either process, students need to sign up as student members of the society. MSRI-UP pays the student membership fees. I will provide more info on the payment method later on. 

Research Presentations(https://www.sacnas.org/conference/research-presentations) - deadline: July 14 
Each abstract submission needs approval from the research mentor 
Only one abstract submission per student is acceptable. (A student with multiple applications will automatically be rejected)
Students working on the same research project are required to submit an abstract written in their own words. If identical abstracts are submitted, all applications will be immediately disqualified from 2023 NDiSTEM.

Travel Scholarships(https://www.sacnas.org/conference/research-presentations) - deadline: July 14 
Each application needs a letter of recommendation (provided by onsite director)
